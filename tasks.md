1. To refactor the codebase: there are some reusable stuff in the lib/ section.. that I don't think is being used correctly.
2. The --LLM tag isn't working really what I wanted it to be. I just wanted it to show the same stuff that the cli is showing, but just in more token efficient way.. but looks like the entire `--llm` tag works on completely seperate idea.
3. Context Engineering -> for making the CLI (the cli-core team ) needs seperate documentation for specs/context
4. Context Engineering -> for using the CLI (the regular AD-dev team ) needs seperate docs.
5. Tools/integrations are not properly made for other AI Agents to effectively use this cli.
